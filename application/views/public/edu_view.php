        	<h5>Mission for the ARRL East Bay Section Education and Training website</h5>
        	<p>The ARRL East Bay Section believes that amateur radio clubs have developed Amateur Radio education and training materials, topics, speakers,
        	 etc. that can be shared to enhance the education and training activities of all clubs. This information is available for amateur radio clubs 
        	 to use to enhance their club Education and Training programs. In addition, amateur radio clubs are invited to send their Education and 
        	 Training program materials to John Primus, AF6RJ 
        	 <a href="mailto:af6rj@arrl.net">af6rj@arrl.net</a>, for review and potential inclusion on the ARRL East Bay Section Education 
        	 and Training website. When sending your Education and Training program materials please ensure that these materials contain contact 
        	 information. By contributing education and training 
        	materials among the amateur radio community it is believed that everyoneâ€™s amateur radio activities and accomplishments can 
        	be enhanced.</p>

        	Disaster Communication, Speakers, etc. Click on the Education and Training Category button at the left of the ARRL East Bay
